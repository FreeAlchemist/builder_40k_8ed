Assault		"A model with an Assault weapon can fire it even If it Advanced earlier that turn.
If it does so, you must substract 1 from any hit rolls made when firing that weapon this turn"												
Rapid Fire		A model firing a Rapid Fire weapon doubles the number of attacks it makes if its target is within half the weapon's maximum range												
Heavy		If a model with a Heavy weapon moved in its preceding Movement phase, you must substract 1 from any hit rolls made when firing that weapon this turn												
Pistol		"A model can fire a Pistol even if there are enemy units within 1"" of its unit, but it must target the closest enemy unit.
In such circumstances, the model can shoot its Pistol even if other friendly units are within 1"" of the same enemy unit.
Each time a model equipped with both a Pistol and another type of ranged weapon shoots, it can either shoot with its Pistol(s) or with all of its other weapons.
Chose which it will fire (Pistols or non-Pistols) before making hit rolls"												
Grenade		Each time a unit shoots, a single model in the unit that is equipped with Grenades may throw one instead of firing any other weapon
